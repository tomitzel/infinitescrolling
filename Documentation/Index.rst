What does it do?
=================

Many TYPO3 extension plugins provide a list view for output. Typically 5 to 20 data records are shown in list view [1],
each with a link to the single view. If there are more than a predefined number of records to show, a page browser [2]
is used to switch between pages of the list view (see image below):

.. figure:: Images/infinite-scroll-tt-news-list.png
		:width: 400px
		:alt: Standard list view of tt_news with page browser at bottom

		Standard list view of tt_news with page browser at bottom
